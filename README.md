AI-based vegetable plant pest classification for sustainable agriculture
This week, the project Smart Pest Detection System using Deep Learning for Sustainable Agriculture was started. The goal is to build an AI model to classify vegetable plant pests to help farmers reduce pesticide use and promote sustainable farming.
Activities Completed:
- Dataset downloaded and explored (500 images, 10 pest categories).
- Checked folder structure and verified sample images.
- Read research papers on pest classification using deep learning and transfer learning.
- Set up the environment with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.
- Tested loading and preprocessing of images (resizing and normalization).

Next Steps:
- Implement transfer learning model for pest classification.
- Apply data augmentation and preprocessing techniques.
- Train and evaluate the model.
